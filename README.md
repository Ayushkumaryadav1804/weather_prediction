# Weather Prediction Project

## Description

This project predicts the temperature for the next day using machine learning. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately predict the temperature for a given day based on historical weather data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) Daily dataset, which can be downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-historical-climatology-network-daily/access/. The dataset contains daily temperature readings for various weather stations around the world.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repo`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Open the `WeatherPrediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train and test the weather prediction model.
3. To use the trained model to predict the temperature for a new day, run the `predict_weather.py` script with the desired date as an argument. For example, `python predict_weather.py 2023-03-18`.

## Credits

This project was created by John Doe as part of the Data Science course at XYZ University. The weather prediction model was built using the Scikit-learn library.
